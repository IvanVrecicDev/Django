.. _disqus_dumpdata:

disqus_dumpdata

Outputs a list of comments in the JSON format.

If neither of the ``--filter`` or ``--exclude`` options are used, the output
will include approved, deleted and spam comments. Each comment will have the data
about its associated Author, Thread and Forum included.

Example output::

    }]


**Options**:

 - ``--indent``: Specifies the indent level to use when pretty-printing output.
   Example: ``./manage.py dumpdata --indent=4``
 - ``--filter``: Type of entries (approved, spam, killed) that should be
   returned. Types can be combined by separating them with a comma. Example:
   ``./manage.py dumpdata --filter=spam,killed``
 - ``--exclude``: Type of entries (approved, spam, killed) that should be
   excluded. Types can be combined by separating them with a comma. Example:
   ``./manage.py dumpdata --exclude=spam,killed``

disqus_export
-------------

Export comments from contrib.comments to DISQUS.

Before you run this command, make sure that ``django.contrib.comments``
and ``django.contrib.sites`` are listed in your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
You also need to change the domain of your Site from ``example.org`` to your
real domain.

The comment's associated content object must have the following two methods:

 - ``get_absolute_url``: Should return the URL of an object. For example: 
   ``/2009/10/10/foo``. This should not include the domain name
 - ``__unicode__``: Unicode representation of the object

The command will export all comments that have the ``is_public``
attribute set to ``True`` and ``is_removed`` set to ``False``. To test which
comments will be exported, you can pass the ``--dry-run`` option.

**Options**:

 - ``-d``/``--dry-run``: Does not export any comments, but merely outputs
   the comments which would have been exported. Example:
   ``./manage.py disqus_export --dry-run``
 - ``-v``/``--verbosity``: Specify the amount of information that should be
   printed to the console. A verbosity of ``0`` will output nothing. The
   default verbosity is ``1`` and print the title of the comments that are
   exported. Example: ``./manage.py disqus_export --verbosity=0``
 - ``-s``/``--state-file``: Specify the filepath where the export command
   should save its state (the id of the last exported comment) into.
   This makes it possible to resume interrupted exports.
