django-disqus 0.3.1
===================

**Release Date**: 01-MAY-2010

This is a bugfix release. The following changes were made:

 - Fixed a bug where the disqus_export command raised an error if non-ascii
   characters were used in the author name.
 - Added "async" attribute to DISQUS JavaScript tag. This loads the comments
   faster on browsers that support the html5 async tag (e.g. firefox).
